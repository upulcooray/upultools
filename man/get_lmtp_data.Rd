\title{Process Covariates for LMTP/TMLE Analysis}
\usage{
get_lmtp_data(data, covs)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the dataset to be processed.}

\item{covs}{A character vector of column names representing the covariates to process.
Variables not listed here are ignored during the type-detection phase but are
retained in the output.}
}
\value{
A data frame with:
\itemize{
\item Binary variables (2 levels) converted to numeric 0/1.
\item Categorical variables (3-6 levels) one-hot encoded with the first level removed (to avoid multicollinearity).
\item Column names cleaned to snake_case.
}
}
\description{
Automatically detects variable types among a specified set of covariates and prepares
them for causal inference analysis (e.g., LMTP or TMLE). It converts binary variables
to 0/1 numeric format and creates dummy variables (one-hot encoding) for categorical
variables with 3 to 6 levels.

\examples{
\dontrun{
df <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  sex = c("M", "F", "M", "M", "F"),
  education = c("HS", "BA", "MA", "PhD", "HS"), # 4 levels
  status = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1),                    # Binary numeric
  age = c(20, 30, 40, 50, 60)                   # Continuous
)

# 'age' will be ignored by encoding because it has >6 levels (all unique)
# 'sex' and 'status' will become 0/1
# 'education' will become dummy columns
clean_df <- process_covariates_lmtp(df, c("sex", "education", "status", "age"))
